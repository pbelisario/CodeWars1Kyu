# [Sliding Puzzle Solver](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a20eeccee1aae3cbc000090)


A sliding puzzle is a combination puzzle that challenges a player to slide (frequently flat) pieces along certain routes (usually on a board) to establish a certain end-configuration.

Your goal for this kata is to write a function that produces a sequence of tile movements that solves the puzzle.

### Input
An **n x n array/list** comprised of integer values ranging from 0 to $n^2$ - 1 (inclusive), which represents a square grid of tiles. Note that there will always be one empty tile (represented by 0) to allow for movement of adjacent tiles.

### Output
An array/list comprised of any (but not necessarily all) of the integers from 1 to $n^2$ - 1, inclusive. This represents the sequence of tile moves for a successful transition from the initial unsolved state to the solved state. If the puzzle is unsolvable, return null(JavaScript, Java, PHP) or None(Python) or the vector {0} (C++).

#### Test Example
    simple_example = [
        [ 1, 2, 3, 4],
        [ 5, 0, 6, 8],
        [ 9,10, 7,11],
        [13,14,15,12]
    ]
    slide_puzzle(simple_example) #[6,7,11,12]

    # TRANSITION SEQUENCE:

    [ 1, 2, 3, 4]    [ 1, 2, 3, 4]    [ 1, 2, 3, 4]    [ 1, 2, 3, 4]    [ 1, 2, 3, 4]
    [ 5, 0, 6, 8]    [ 5, 6, 0, 8]    [ 5, 6, 7, 8]    [ 5, 6, 7, 8]    [ 5, 6, 7, 8]
    [ 9,10, 7,11] -> [ 9,10, 7,11] -> [ 9,10, 0,11] -> [ 9,10,11, 0] -> [ 9,10,11,12]
    [13,14,15,12]    [13,14,15,12]    [13,14,15,12]    [13,14,15,12]    [13,14,15, 0]

    # NOTE: Your solution does not need to follow this exact sequence to pass

#### Technical Details
- Input will always be valid.
- The range of values for n are: 10 >= n >= 3
